## Intro
Welcome to Carrot Labs. We make stupid games for even stupider people. If you always lose to your pet rock whilst playing *rock-paper-scissors*, then you somehow stubbled into the right place.

We are an indie game studio in name only. Our goal is to build small games for the fun of it (and be a little crass in the process). Check out our projects below.
